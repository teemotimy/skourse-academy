            "I'm heading back to Colorado tomorrow after being down in Santa Barbara over the weekend for the festival there. I will be making October plans once there and will try to arrange so I'm back here for the birthday if possible. I'll still need to mow the lawn, feed the dogs, and prep the kids for the babysitter. I'll let you know as soon as I know the doctor's appointment schedule and my flight plans."
